=== WHAT & WHY? ===

This is alternative decoder plugin for module music (MOD, XM,
IT, etc) based on libxmp.

I wrote it because libmodplug plays some modules incorrectly,
especialy that ones with stereo samples and filter effects.


=== BUILDING ===

To build you need a libxmp (http://xmp.sourceforge.net/).
Then copy directory 'xmp' into 'decoder_plugins' and add
a line to file 'decoders.m4':

    m4_include(decoder_plugins/xmp/xmp.m4)

and lines to 'Makefile.am':

    if BUILD_xmp
        SUBDIRS += xmp
    endif

These files located under directory 'decoder_plugins'.

On the next step build 'moc' without modplug.
After building is done run moc and enjoy the music!
